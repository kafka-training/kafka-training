## start zookeeper general

Starting ZooKeeper as a service allows it to run in the background, restart on boot, and be managed like other system services. The method of installing ZooKeeper as a service can vary depending on the Linux distribution and the specific configuration of ZooKeeper. Here is a general method for starting ZooKeeper as a service on an Ubuntu system, and then checking its status.

**Step 1: Create a Service File**

First, you need to create a systemd service file for ZooKeeper. Open a new file in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory named `zookeeper.service`:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service

```

Add the following content to the file, making sure to replace `/path/to/zookeeper` with the actual path to your ZooKeeper installation:

```
[Unit]
Description=Apache ZooKeeper
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/path/to/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start /path/to/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg
ExecStop=/path/to/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh stop /path/to/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg
ExecReload=/path/to/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh restart /path/to/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg
User=zookeeper
Group=zookeeper
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

```

Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` and `Enter` to save and exit.

This configuration specifies how to start, stop, and restart ZooKeeper. The `User` and `Group` options should be set to the user and group that should own the ZooKeeper process. You may need to create this user and group if they do not exist.

**Step 2: Enable and Start the Service**

You can now enable and start the ZooKeeper service. Enabling the service makes it start on boot:

```
sudo systemctl enable zookeeper
sudo systemctl start zookeeper

```

**Step 3: Check the Service Status**

You can check the status of the ZooKeeper service with this command:

```
sudo systemctl status zookeeper

```

This should show the status of the service, including whether it is currently running.

Please note that these steps are a general guide and may need to be adapted depending on the specifics of your system and ZooKeeper configuration. Be sure to properly configure the ZooKeeper `zoo.cfg` configuration file to suit your needs.
